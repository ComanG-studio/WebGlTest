# Introduction

Simple test for how good unity is at handling WebGL. This version was built with Unity 2018.2.3f1 and the build can be seen here: http://www.johannesdeml.com/data/out/unityloading/  
The server is not configured to handle the traffic in any specific way, so there are still ways to optimize the loading times.
